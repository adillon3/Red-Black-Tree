RED BLACK TREE RULES
- The Root must always be BLACK
- No RED node can have a RED child (and therefore, not RED node can have a RED parent)
- Each path to a leaf node must have the same number of BLACK nodes in the path



This Red Black Tree does not allow for two nodes with the same value to be entered into the tree
